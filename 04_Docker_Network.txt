When starting docker all containers run on the docker virtual environment

Processes outside of docker virtual network can communicate with containers only if the containers expose some ports

The default bridge network, allows simple container-to-container communication by IP address, and is created by default.
    
    docker network ls: list the networkd
    docker inspect <container_id> | grep IPAddress: get the ip of a container ("IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",)

A user-defined bridge network, which you create yourself, and allows your containers to communicate with each other, by using their container name as a hostname
    
    docker network create tulip-net: create the network  tulip-net
    docker run --rm --net tulip-net --name tulipnginx -d nginx: attach the container to the network
    docker network connect tulip-net mongodb: attach an already running container to the netowrk
