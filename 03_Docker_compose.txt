Docker compose: start multiple containers as a larger app 

    version: '3'  (version that specifies the format of file)
    docker-compose.yml:

    services:
        service-name:
            image: 'image name'
        service-name:
            build: . (build the image based on Dockerfile in the current directory)
            ports:
                - "8080:8080"

Networking: for containers created in the same docker-compose file

    Containers that will be created in the same compose file will be created in the same network
    Containers from the same compose (same network) can use service name to refer as host(db connection) with other services
    Docker will see that has a service with that name and will redirect the request to the service


Commands:

    docker-compose up: run the compose file
    docker-compose up --build: run the compose file and rebuild the images
    docker-compose up -d: start the containers in the background
