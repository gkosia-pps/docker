Image: contains all dependencies and configuration to create a container
       Is a FS Snapshot(copy of files) and a startup command
Container: an instance of an image
           An isolated (own memory, disk space) program


docker run [-it] image_name:

    1. Docker server check in the image cache if has the image locally
    2. If has the image runs a new container in local Docker server
    3. If the image is not in the cache goes to dockerhub to find the image

Specific to linux: when run docker in windows or mac we have the LVM(linux virtual machine)
    Namespacing: Create segments of isolated resources per process(specific hard disk aerea, network devices..)
    Control groups: limit the amount of resources can be used from a process (memory, cpu, IO, bandwith)


Docker client:

    overide command: we can override the command specified in the image 
                     We cannot overide the command of a container that already started. 
                     A container run always the command it had when created

        docker run <image> [<overide command>]
    
    list containers:

        docker ps: list the running containers
                   -a: show all containers that created
    
    create container:

        docker create <image>: create a container from the image

    start container:

        docker start -a <containerid>: start an existing container
                                       -a: attach the terminal to container and show me the output from container
    cleanup docker env:
        
        docker system prune: delete images, containers, networks
    
    get logs of container:

        docker logs <containerid>
